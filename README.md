# VEX Robotics Coding Template

A simple, beginner-friendly codebase to help new members learn how to program VEX robots efficiently.  
This project provides a streamlined starting point using [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/), [LemLib](https://lemlib.github.io/), and standard C++ conventions.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This template is designed to make it easier for students to:
- Learn the basics of VEX robotics programming.
- Understand project structure and organization in PROS.
- Quickly start building autonomous and driver control programs.

---

## 🗂 Where to Start

The code with comments is located here (will not compile):
[Open main.cpp](PROS-LEMLIB%20Template/src/main.cpp)

Open this file in **Visual Studio Code** to see the full code with explanation, including:
- Motor and sensor setup
- Pneumatics example
- LemLib drivetrain and controllers
- Autonomous and driver control functions

This file contains the latest version of PROS and Lemlib as of November 1st, 2025.

The main template code without detailed comments is located here (will compile):
[Open main.cpp](63310%20Main/src/main.cpp)
